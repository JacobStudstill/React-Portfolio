                        Hello, my name is Jacob Studstill. I am an inspiring Full-Stack Developer enrolled in the University of Central Florida Full-Stack Development Coding Bootcamp which will come to an end in March of 2023. I have had my hand in applications which include E-Commerce websites, social media APIs,
                        password generators, and employee tracking systems. Following the bootcamp I will be searching for full-stack, front-end, and back-end developement jobs. The contact portion of the page will link to my GitHub to see the current projects I am working on and
                        reach out if you have any questions.
                    </p>
